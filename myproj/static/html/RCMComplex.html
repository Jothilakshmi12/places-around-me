        Revenue cycle management (RCM) is the financial process, utilizing medical billing software, that healthcare facilities use to track patient care episodes from registration and appointment scheduling to the final payment of a balance.<br>
        RCM unifies the business and clinical sides of healthcare by coupling administrative data, such as a patient's name, insurance provider and other personal information, with the treatment a patient receives and their healthcare data.<br>
        Communicating with health insurance companies is a key component of RCM.<br>
        When a patient schedules an appointment, the physician's office or the hospital staff typically check the patient's reported insurance coverage before the visit.<br>
